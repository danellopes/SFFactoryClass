### Example of the Factory Design Pattern (Class)

This example of the faceted builder design pattern was develop using C# language.

When working with small objects, it makes sense to have Factory Methods inside the object itself, but when working with large ones, we may want to separate the responsibility to another class, a factory class. The problem with this approach is that we end up having to make our constructors public.
